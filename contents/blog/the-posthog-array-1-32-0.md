### Other improvements & fixes

- Plus x+ improvements & fixes.

### Deprecation & removal notices

1. Since the previous version (1.31.0), we no longer supports a Postgres-only deployment of PostHog. Read [our migration guide](/docs/self-host/migrate-from-postgres-to-clickhouse) for instructions on moving over to a ClickHouse version. ClickHouse provides faster queries and is optimized for very large volumes of data, and you will also get a new lot of features.
2. We're removing support for insights with "Minute" intervals. From user feedback, these insights were hard to parse and could lead to significant performance issues in self-hosted instances. Please [reach out](/support) if you have any feedback on this.
3. We're [removing the **Sessions** insight](/blog/sessions-removal) (distribution of session length). Please [reach out](/support) if you have any feedback on this.
